# Car Seat Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

# Overview
The dataset contains 400 ovservation on the following 11 attributes:

● Sales - Unit sales (in thousands) at each location
● CompPrice - Price charged by a competitor at each location
● Income - Community income level (in thousands of dollars)
● Advertising - Local advertising budget for the company at each
location (in thousands of dollars)
● Population - Population size in the region (in thousands)
● Price - Price company charges for car seats at each site
● ShelveLoc - A factor with levels Bad, Good, and Medium
indicating the quality of the shelving location for the car seats at
each site
● Age - Average age of the local population
● Education - Education level at each location
● Urban - A factor with levels No and Yes to indicate whether the
store is in an urban or rural location
● US – A factor with levels No and Yes to indicate whether the store
is in the US or not

During this project, I will perform data analysis on the Carseats dataset. The Statistical analysis begins with a Univariate analysis of the variables followed by a bivariate analysis to study the correlations 
and ultimately aims to fit a multiple linear regression model for the Sales. In the end, I will compare
models using various techniques to find the most suitable model.
